## Delaunay Tessellation of  Proteins three dimensional protein chain using Python, Biopython, Scipy and Mayavi.

Delaunay Tessellation of  Proteins three dimensional protein chain using Python, Biopython, Scipy and Mayavi.

### Prerequisites

The script is written in Python3
* Python3
* Biopython
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Mayavi

Libraries can be installed by using the Python Package Index - PIP.
It is convenient to install Mayavi by creating a Python2 virtual environment, and then installing the other prerequisites

```
pip install <package-name>
```

The code creates the Delaunay Tessellation construct of three dimensional protein chain. Statistics for the Delaunay construct are saved in a .csv file, and the visualization is saved in .x3d file format.
The visualization can then be embedded on a website.
